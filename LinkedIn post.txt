🚀 **Excited to share my latest project: Food Delivery Real-Time Data Analysis!** 🛵🍕  

In today’s fast-paced world, real-time data analysis is a game-changer. I built a **real-time data pipeline** for food delivery systems, leveraging the power of **AWS services** and big data technologies.  

🔍 **Project Highlights:**  
- 📦 **Data Orchestration:** Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA) to manage workflows seamlessly.  
- ⚡ **Real-Time Data Processing:** Amazon Kinesis for streaming live order data, processed using **PySpark on EMR**, and ingested into **Amazon Redshift**.  
- 📊 **Data Visualization:** Insights brought to life with Amazon QuickSight dashboards.  
- 🛠️ **AWS Stack:** S3, Redshift, Kinesis, EMR, Airflow, and CodeBuild for a robust and scalable architecture.  

📂 **Key Features:**  
- Dimensional and fact tables in Redshift initialized with Airflow.  
- PySpark script for processing micro-batches from Kinesis and loading them into Redshift.  
- Mock data generator to simulate real-world scenarios.  
- End-to-end orchestration and security configurations like VPC endpoints and IAM roles.  

💡 **What I Learned:**  
- Building fault-tolerant pipelines and integrating diverse AWS services.  
- Managing real-time data streaming and processing with Spark and Kinesis.  
- Creating reusable workflows for automated data ingestion.  

🎯 **Next Steps:**  
I’m looking forward to exploring enhancements like advanced monitoring with CloudWatch, infrastructure automation with Terraform, and extending pipelines to support more use cases.
